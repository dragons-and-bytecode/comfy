It is time to admit: It has been getting a bit rusty lately.\r\n\r\nTo polish it up, and let the old girl shine as new again, we created **Comfy**, a lightweight dialect preprocessor to C, to (hopefully) keep us from becoming completely insane while we are developing our bigger game engine project.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is not really necessary; Maybe this is even stupid. But it seems like fun, and could just maybe turn out to be something really good. :)\r\n\r\nAs the **Comfy** dialect grows, we will be keeping track about all the little changes from the original C language here.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Automatic include guard\r\n\r\n    @version: FUTURE\r\n\r\nI never met anybody, who used includes in a way, that they didn't profit from\r\ninclude guards. Thus (except for lazyness) I have never seen C (or C++) code\r\nthat didn't include-guard its headers.\r\n\r\nThe **Comfy** preprocessor will therefore prepend any header it is given with\r\nan include guard automatically.\r\n\r\nThe following is therefore not neccessary anymore:\r\n\r\n    #ifndef __headername__\r\n    #define __headername__\r\n\r\n    //Your code goes here...\r\n\r\n    #endif\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
