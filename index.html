<p>The comfortable C dialect.</p>

<p>The C language with it's bare metal simplicity and no-nonsence attitude is awesome.</p>

<p>But since it has been with us for a long time now, it has been getting on a bit. It is time to admit: It has been getting a bit rusty lately.</p>

<p>To polish it up, and let the old girl shine as new again, we created <strong>Comfy</strong>, a lightweight dialect preprocessor to C, to (hopefully) keep us from becoming completely insane while we are developing our bigger game engine project.</p>

<p>Maybe this is not really necessary; Maybe this is even stupid. But it seems like fun, and could just maybe turn out to be something really good. :)</p>

<p>As the <strong>Comfy</strong> dialect grows, we will be keeping track about all the little changes from the original C language here.</p>

<a id="automatic-include-guard" class="anchor" href="#automatic-include-guard" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automatic include guard</h2>

<pre><code>@version: FUTURE
</code></pre>

<p>I never met anybody, who used includes in a way, that they didn't profit from
include guards. Thus (except for lazyness) I have never seen C (or C++) code
that didn't include-guard its headers.</p>

<p>The <strong>Comfy</strong> preprocessor will therefore prepend any header it is given with
an include guard automatically.</p>

<p>The following is therefore not neccessary anymore:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef __headername__
#define __headername__

//Your code goes here...

#endif
</code></pre>
